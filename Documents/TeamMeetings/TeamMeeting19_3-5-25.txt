Julio
    - updated file to classify MBTI types to attributes
    - labels are repetitive right now, going to rethink that
        - either add weights or correspond traits with letters to get less similar tags
    - added to pull user.csv, predict all models, look at traits, get the mean of scores, and keep the highest
    - prep_users file takes all models and gives scores for all users
