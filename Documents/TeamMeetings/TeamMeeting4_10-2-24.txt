Should be starting requirements document
	• Still need more information

Julio messaged again
	• No response yet
	• Julio will email tomorrow morning if not answered yet
	• And Whatsapp

Changes to be made:
	• Scope
	• Assumptions
	• Pretty much everything

Flex Website:
	• Messy, hard to find information
		○ Possibly use that for charter changes
	• Ran demo
		○ Outputs long list of games, achievements, decimal numbers
	• Other data sources
		○ Riot, Xbox?
	• Does it work with a steam account set to private?
		○ Runs to infinity

Diagrams
	• Put on charter? Requirements document?

Brainstorm Ideas for Requirements for next meeting
	• Assuming access to everything

Assuming this access
	• Make final charter changes hopefully by Sunday
