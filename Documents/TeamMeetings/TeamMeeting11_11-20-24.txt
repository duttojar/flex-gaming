Everyone here:
	• Julio had a concert (notified far in advance)
	• Daunte also could not make it

Updates:
	• Dealing with major requirements issues when trying to debug locally
	• Also dealing with auth issues (.env file blank but login route uses it)
	• Noah created a guide for digital ocean
	• Leo still looking into overarching model
		○ Jonathan asked him to think of ways to combine three of the models
		○ Leo thinks tweak to the tagging process could do that
			§ Maybe a scale for grit/problem solving/perception
			§ Would be a very large training process, so maybe use Google Collab
				□ Could cost
		○ Also looked into more models that could be used to create an enwrapping personality report (NBTI)
	• Deadline: 
		○ model finished and in full production by end of semester.

Questions for tomorrow:
	1. Requirement contradictions/python version possibly
	2. Where does the input data come from for API calls
		a. If it comes from beta engine, what is the response so that we could replicate
	3. What he wants us to do about auth/.env (either take out line or create .env)
	4. Retraining for perception (new description)

Auth Questions:
	1. Using digital ocean to create users
	2. Different auths for all of us so that we don't have to use the same one

Leo Questions:
	1. How crazy does he want to push this mega model?
		○ Combine them all or something else
	2. What is next? Pros and Cons for options
		○ Discord?
		○ Mega model?
		○ Touching up on everything?
		○ Website?
