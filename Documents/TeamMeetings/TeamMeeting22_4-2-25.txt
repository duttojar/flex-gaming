Noah
- bot prompts start assessment, get achievements
- get achievements prints most recent achievements from past 2 weeks
- working on start assessment
- would like enriched achievements to be checked for given achievements
    - pull label if in list
    - if not, tag and add missing ones to enriched_achievements.csv for future models
    - could maybe instead use database
    - or create a new table to use for discord_achievements_enriched
- got user sessions working (depending on getByID from beta-engine)

Max
- alembic migrations work without error now
    - API container couldn't connect to database container, now it does
- has not tested API calls to the database

Jared
- created package for docker image for db
- changes to main now automatically update image
- created models-db repo
    - exposes Daunte's code to then use other repos
- will add instructions

Daunte
- local testing works for models
    - set up for Jonathan to push to main
- hasn't heard from Jonathan whether he can use alchemy instead of current code
- renaming is good once Jonathan updates Render
- pretty much done with security

Leo
- data collection done
- 15 users with achievements
- will then be used for validation data
- having issue with API calls taking long because every game and every achievement is looked through
